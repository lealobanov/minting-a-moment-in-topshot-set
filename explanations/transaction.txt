To mint a Moment in the TopShot system, you start by borrowing a reference to the Admin resource from the authorized account. This reference grants access to administrative functions, including minting Moments and managing sets. Next, you use the borrowSet function on the Admin reference to access the specific Set resource by its setID. The Set resource contains the functionality needed to mint Moments associated with a particular play.

To store the minted Moments in the recipient's account, you need a capability reference to the recipient's collection, which can accept the NFTs. Using this reference, you can deposit the Moments into their collection. In this scenario, the batchMintMoment function is used to mint multiple Moments at once.

The transaction specifies the playID for the Moments being minted and the desired quantity. After minting, the resulting collection of Moments is deposited directly into the recipient's collection.
